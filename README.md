# ClientServices
ClientServices-Design Pattern (CS-DP) - How-To Lift-n-Shift, modernize C# applications and codebases.

## Introduction
- ClientServices is a design pattern that is used to build, implement, any variation of legacy or modern C# UI client applications that interacts with backend services. 
- This 'initial' commit is a simple, 'read-only' Todos list implementation  that pulls data from a RESTful API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), and is intended to demonstrate the 'how-to' lift-n-shift and/or proposed refactoring strategy for modernizing C# applications and codebases.
